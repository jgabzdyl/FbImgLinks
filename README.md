# FbImgLinks
You know that feeling when you stumble on a comic on facebook, and it's not complete... So you open the theatre view, only to find out the pic is resized to fit your screen, and the quality is disgusting (literally unreadable). So you open the developer console, find the link to the full image and open it in new tab.

Well no more. If it has ploi, it now has a link to open it in new tab.

Enjoy
